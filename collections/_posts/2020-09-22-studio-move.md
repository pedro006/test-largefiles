title: Studio move
description: >-
  On the first of the month we moved our studio to Industry City in Brooklyn—
  three weeks later the office went fully remote!


  We are grateful to all our clients who continue to forge ahead with their projects, and to the contractors, consultants and fabricators who we collaborate with.


  Given all the uncertainty and sadness of the moment, it was heartwarming to be greeted by this construction fence graffiti on a dreary site visit— *stay hopeful!*
