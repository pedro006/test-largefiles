  - text: Our work is enriched by research and influenced by the physical, cultural,
      historical yet that doesn’t mean that we’re pretentious and self-obsessed.
      We don’t alienate. Instead, we prefer to be honest, deliberate, and open.
      And even though we might do high end cultural work, clients don’t shy away
      from hiring us to do simple bathroom renovations.

  - text: The solutions and craft in our work are thoughtful, finely detailed, yet
      coherent, simple, methodical. Special or precious is generally less useful
      than normal, and less rewarding in the long term. We prefer to be
      essential. We are immersed in a rigorous, hands on process that is
      immersive and sometimes messy, attuned to both traditional tools and new
      technology in order to achieve the highest quality work. That is, we
      sketch. We draw by hand. We build physical models. We render digitally and
      utilize 3D goggles. The result of this process is a careful calibration of
      ideas, rigorously tested and refined, and an expression of something
      essential and straightforward.
